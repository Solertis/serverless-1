	 * The only required function that you should implement, if no mock data provided in your Remove[[Model]][[Ref]].json
	 * 
	 * The execute function will be triggered when an application or device makes a call to delete [bluenimble-space].[bluenimble-instance].bluenimble.com/[[api]]/[[models]]
	 * which is defined in your service specification file Remove[[Model]][[Ref]].json 
	 * 
	 * Arguments:
	 *  Api 		 the api where this service is running  
	 *  ApiConsumer  the user, application, or device calling this service. It could be a ApiConsumer.Type.Token, ApiConsumer.Type.Cookie, ApiConsumer.Type.Signature, 
	 *				 ApiConsumer.Type.Basic or ApiConsumer.Type.Unknown
	 *  ApiRequest 	 the parameters, headers and streams. 
	 *               ex. request.get ('email') to get a parameter called 'email'
	 *               request.get ('Token', ApiRequest.Scope.Header) to get an http or CoAp header called 'Token'
	 *               request.get ('myfile', ApiRequest.Scope.Stream) to get a stream called 'myfile' (uploads) 
	 *  ApiResponse  to set headers to send back to the calling device or application 
	 * 				 response.set ('X-MyHeader', 'Hello');
	 *				 you can also write data to the response but this is rarely will happen as the platform takes care of this.
