/**
 * 
 * This is where you write your service specification.
 * Spec:
 *  <verb>     	The request verb. Allowed values 'get', 'post', 'put', 'delete' 
 *  <endpoint> 	The path or uri to call this service. Example /users or /users/:user where ':user' is an uri parameter
 *  <runtime> 	A section to define extra application specific data to be used at runtime. 
 *				For javascript developers, the runtime section should define the 'function' to execute by this service
 *  <security> 	In this section, you can define which security methods are supported by this service.
 *				the platform default security methods are 'token', 'basic', 'cookie', 'signature'. Here is an example of allowing only calls 
 *				sending over a token as a request header or a signature:
 *   			"security": {
 *					"methods": ["token", "signature"]
 *				}
 *				Note: 
 *					- This is optional. It's needed only if you want to restrict a service to be called using a specific security method
 *					- These methods should be enabled at the api specification file 'api.json' in order to take effect
 *  <spi>   	Which scripting language and implementation to use.
 *				for javascript developers it's always "class": "scripting.javascript:ServiceSpi"
 *  <mock>		This section is useful when prototyping, without the need to code the business logic behind.
 *				Here, you can put data to return back to the calling application. It helps IoT and front-end developers 
 *				to move fast without waiting for back-end logic to be ready.
 *				Example:
 *				"mock": {
 *					// the mock data will be taken in consideration only if "enable" is "true". 
 *					// means, you can always keep your mock data and turn off "enabled"
 *					"enabled": "true",
 *					// your mock service result here.
 *					"output": {
 *						"title": "iPad 2 Silver",
 *						"price": "$560"
 *					}
 *				}
